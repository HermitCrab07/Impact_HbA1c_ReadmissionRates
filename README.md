### Impact of Measurement of HbA1c on Hospital Readmission: Diabetes Dataset - Revisiting 2014 Research

#### Overview
This repository aims to complement a diabetes study published in 2014, which highlighted the protective role of HbA1C measurements against early readmission in diabetes patients. Over a decade has passed since the original publication and significant advancements in AI gives us new tools and perspectives to reassess the data and conclusions drawn at the time. My interest in this data is for two reasons - [1] I've a personal interest in controlling diabetes [2] The paper raised some interesting questions that I wanted to evaluate. 

#### Purpose
The primary goal of this is not to recreate the original analysis but to augment it using AI/ML methods, specifically look at the data from the causal inference lens. This approach aims to uncover deeper insights and assess the validity of the study's recommendations with today's advanced tools. There isn't enough data to recreate the analyses and I don't have the desire nor interest to do. I use the paper from 2014 more as a springboard to ask a different questions and move it forward from there.

#### Analysis Approach
- **Re-evaluation with Modern Tools**: Applying causal inference and machine learning techniques to the dataset.
- **Documentation of My Thought Process**: This repository will focus on the thought process of re-analyzing this dataset and more importantly, doing a real deep dive using the simplest of tools. It's the way I like to approach any data analysis. In what follows, I try to articulate my thought process, assumptions, and conclusions drawn from the analysis. It's my way of doing a deep dive. It's simple because that's how I really get a feel of the data. Lot of basic cross-tabs are what I use to get a 'handle' on the data... and only after that, do I move on to more complex analysis.

#### Why This Matters
Even without a background in the medical field, the importance of management plans for conditions like diabetes is obvious to me and everyone else, but by revisiting this paper with new methods and new perspectives, my hope is to add another aspect to the conversation and potentially validate or refine the strategies for managing diabetes, contributing to improved outcomes. I hope.
