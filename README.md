### Impact_of_HbA1c_on_Readmission_Rates: Diabetes Dataset Analysis - Revisiting 2014 Research with Modern AI/ML Approaches

#### Overview
This repository aims to evaluate and complement a diabetes study published in 2014, which highlighted the protective role of HbA1C measurements against early readmission in diabetes patients. Over a decade has passed since the original publication and significant advancements in AI gives us new tools and perspectives to reassess the data and conclusions drawn at the time.

#### Purpose
The primary goal of this is not to recreate the original analysis but to augment it using contemporary AI/ML methods, specifically causal AI/ML. This approach aims to uncover deeper insights and assess the validity of the study's recommendations with today's advanced tools.

#### Analysis Approach
- **Re-evaluation with Modern Tools**: Applying modern causal inference and machine learning techniques.
- **Documentation of Thought Process**: Unlike typical analyses that focus heavily on numeric outputs and tables, this repository focuses on the thought process and theoretical underpinnings of re-analyzing this dataset and more importantly, doing a real deep dive.
- **Insight and Understanding**: The emphasis is placed on understanding the implications of the data and providing a qualitative assessment of the original study's conclusions in light of current technology and knowledge. In what follows, I try to articulate the thought process, assumptions, challenges, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

#### Why This Matters
Even without a background in the medical field, the importance of management plans for conditions like diabetes is obvious to everyone, but by revisiting this research with new perspective, we can potentially validate or refine the strategies for managing diabetes, contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.
